# Notes

Click buttons in React Native Android App and hear the notes played on a speaker connected to an Arduino Uno

## Crazy stuff

1. I had to comment out and @Override in the RCTBluetoothSerialPackage.java in node_modules 'react-native-bluetooth-serial' folder
    * line 23 of RCTBluetoothSerialPackage.java that is found by going to the folders:
        * android/src/main/java/com/rusel/RCTBluetoothSerial/RCTBluetoothSerialPackage.java

## Things To Do

1. Make the layout look nicer.
1. Split up the code.
1. MOR REUSABLE COMPONENTS
1. Do the notes play as long as the note button in the app is pressed?
